-- lists in haskell!!!

{-
Lists are homegenous data structure!!! -> stores several elements of the SAME type

Use 'let' to define a name right in GHCI. Doing 'let a = 1' in GHCI equivalent to writing 'a=1' in a script and then loading it :D
Strings are also synthetic sugar for list of chars -> means we can use list functions on them

Putting 2 lists together -> using the '++' operator
